To list and navigate files in Helix, you’ll use its powerful file picker system, which replaces the traditional file tree with fuzzy search and modal navigation. Here's how to do it:

📁 File Listing in Helix
Helix doesn’t show a sidebar file tree like VS Code. Instead, it uses pickers—interactive windows that let you jump to files quickly.
🔍 Open the File Picker
- Press Space + f in Normal Mode
→ This opens a fuzzy file picker at the project root (usually where .git is located).
🧭 Navigate Files
- Start typing part of the filename (e.g. app, globals, tsx)
- Use arrow keys or j/k to move through results
- Press Enter to open the selected file
📂 Open a Directory
You can also launch Helix directly into a directory:
hx .


This opens the file picker scoped to that folder and its subdirectories.

🛠 Bonus Pickers
| Picker Type | Shortcut | Description | 
| File Picker | Space + f | Fuzzy search files | 
| Global Search | Space + / | Search across all files | 
| Buffer Picker | Space + b | Switch between open files | 
| Symbol Picker | Space + s | List functions/variables in current file | 
| Workspace Symbols | Space + S | Search symbols across project |
