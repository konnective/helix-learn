Configuring Line Spacing and Tab Settings in VS Code
VS Code allows you to customize the spacing between lines and the behavior of tabs and indentation to match your personal preferences and project requirements. 
1. Adjusting line spacing (line height)
Open Settings: Press Ctrl+, (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+, (Mac) or navigate to File > Preferences > Settings.
Search for editor.lineHeight: In the search bar, type editor.lineHeight.
Set the value: The editor.lineHeight setting accepts a numerical value.
0 (auto): Uses a default value based on your font size and may vary depending on the font you are using.
Values greater than 0: Represent a multiplier relative to the font size. For example, a value of 1.2 will create a line height 1.2 times the font size.
Absolute Values: In some fonts and configurations, you might be able to set an absolute value for the line height, usually in pixels.
Restart/Reload VS Code: Changes to line height often require a restart or reload of the VS Code window to take effect, according to Stack Overflow. 
2. Configuring tab settings
To adjust tab settings, open the Settings as described above. Search for and modify "Tab Size" (the number of spaces a tab represents) and "Insert Spaces" (whether pressing Tab inserts spaces or tab characters). You can also configure "Detect Indentation" to control whether VS Code automatically detects indentation styles. Use the "Format Document" command (Shift+Alt+F) or "Format On Save" to apply these settings. 
3. Language-specific settings
VS Code allows you to apply different settings for line spacing and tabs for specific programming languages. Access these by opening Settings and using the @lang filter (e.g., @lang:javascript tabsize) or through the language mode picker in the status bar. 
4. Using EditorConfig for consistent styling
EditorConfig files (.editorconfig) can help maintain consistent coding styles, especially in projects with multiple developers. Extensions like EditorConfig for VS Code can apply these settings automatically. 
Important notes
Consider the scope of your settings; User settings are global, while Workspace settings are project-specific and override user settings. Extensions like Prettier can also influence formatting and have their own configuration options. Remember that restarting VS Code might be necessary for some setting changes to take full effect. By customizing these settings, you can enhance your coding experience in VS Code.
